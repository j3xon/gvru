**[1] Lag**  
> When you are driving and you experience a significant amount of lag, pull over to the side and wait for it to stop.

**[2] Banned Vehicles**  
> Ensure you have the correct role for your vehicle. If caught driving a banned vehicle without the proper roles, it will escalate to a session removal.

**[3] Peace Status and Rules**  
> During peace time, you are not allowed to drift, run from law enforcement (LEO), rob stores, or drive recklessly. If you are caught breaking any of these rules, you will be removed from the roleplay session. The fail roleplay speed during this peacetime is 75 mph.  
> During strict peace time, you are not allowed to drift, run from law enforcement, etc., and the fail roleplay speed is 65 mph. If caught breaking any of these rules, it will result in a server infraction and session removal.  
> During peace time off, you are allowed to drift, run from law enforcement, rob stores, hard brake, etc. The fail roleplay speed during this time will be 100 mph. Being caught going over this speed will result in session removal.

**[4] Traffic Stops**  
> When a law enforcement member pulls you over, you must pull over to the nearest parking lot or to the right side of the road (emergency lane). All information must be provided to law enforcement when asked. Failing to do so will result in an arrest and license suspension.

**[5] Staff Stops**  
> When a staff member pulls you over, you are not allowed to drive away. If caught doing so, they can remove you from the session, and an infraction will be issued.

**[6] General Tips**  
> Ensure you are recording your gameplay by using Medals, SteelSeries, etc. This will be useful if you encounter trouble for no reason.  
> Respect all members within the roleplay session; otherwise, you may be marked for it.  
> Ensure you are following Roblox TOS while roleplaying, or this can lead to your account being reported.  
> No starting drama within the session; doing so will result in removal and an infraction.`)
